-Goal-
Given the file uploaded that is relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities. Please be exhaustive by extracting implicit relationships and implied entities including abstract entities and relationships.

DO NOT add any explanatory text outside of the instructions below in the specific format described.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as CREATE <entity_type>:`<entity_name>` SET description="<entity_description>"

 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as RELATE <source_entity_type>:`<source_entity>`->{relation_type}-><target_entity_type>:`<target_entity>` SET description="<relationship_description>", strength=<relationship_strength>
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output the completion delimiter: {completion_delimiter}

Additional considerations: Make sure to identify all cross-relationships between the multiple types of entities as well as relationships between entities of the same type. Take special note of any hierarchal representations within the relationships. When in doubt be generous and add extra relationships but indicate the weakness with the strength score.

TechGlobal's (TG) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Global Exchange Thursday. But IPO experts warn that the semiconductor corporation's debut on the public markets isn't indicative of how other newly listed companies may perform.

TechGlobal, a formerly public company, was taken private by Vision Holdings in 2014. The well-established chip designer says it powers 85% of premium smartphones.

Text:
Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.

CONTINUE_PROMPT = """MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. Try to identify relationships that may be weaker or were not apparent at your first attempt. Make sure to have at least one relationship for each entity even if it is to itself. AND make sure to add any entities mentioned in relationships.

Remember to ONLY emit entities that match any of the previously extracted types and do NOT extract the entities from the examples sections. Add them below using the same format.
